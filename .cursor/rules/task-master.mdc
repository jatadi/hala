As you complete tasks and reference relevant files, **update this file**.  
Keep each line short, add new tasks at the bottom of a section, and move tasks between sections instead of rewriting them.

Tasks should be broken down into managable chunks and clearly outlined with a goal and a process. Each task will have a description, status, dependencies and complexity (1-10). As we keep progressing through the project, you will update this file to add more tasks, tick off completed tasks, update accordingly when needed for dependencies, complexity and status.
